The future King George III did, of course, and three weeks after his father’s death in 1751, his grandfather King George II put the young royal in line to inherit the British throne. The younger—and still single—George succeeded his grandfather in 1760 at age 22, making his search for a wife urgent. He eyed Charlotte, then 17, over other candidates for a couple of key reasons.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Born Princess Sophia Charlotte in 1744 in Mecklenberg-Strelitz, which is now part of Germany, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.hrp.org.uk/kew-palace/history-and-stories/queen-charlotte/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="she had" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">she had</a> good royal credentials and was a Protestant.

The roughly three-week trip at sea was arduous, with the travel party facing multiple storms along the way. Charlotte was so thin from seasickness by the time she arrived that her wedding dress nearly fell off.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Even with George’s eventful reign—the American Revolutionary War, the French Revolutionary wars in the 1790s, and the incorporation of Ireland in 1801 all happened on his watch—the first 25 years of their marriage were generally happy.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">A Palace Full of Children and a Musical Bond</h2><img alt="queen charlotte posing for a portrait with two of her children" title="Queen Charlotte with her two sons, Prince George and Prince Frederick" width=3424 height=5315 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/queen-charlotte-with-her-two-eldest-sons-1769-found-in-the-news-photo-1683049324.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>A 1769 portrait shows Queen Charlotte with her two eldest sons, George and Frederick.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">George and Charlotte had <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.royal.uk/queen-charlotte data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="15 children" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">15 children</a>, starting with son George Augustus Frederick in 1762 who ascended the throne as King George IV at age 57.

When George became uncharacteristically sexually aggressive, the decision was made to temporarily isolate him at Kew Palace. These symptoms recurred every few years until 1810, when the king finally became incapacitated and his eldest son—George, the Prince of Wales—became prince regent. Out of the public eye, the king <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://research.colonialwilliamsburg.org/Foundation/journal/Spring10/king.cfm data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=conversed class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">conversed</a> with dead people, including his daughter Amelia and what he believed were angels.
