He had dinner with us and he didn't have a lot to say for himself. But it was her first boyfriend and we assumed it would fizzle out," she told The Sun.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>However, on the night of May 3, 2019, Griffiths brutally murdered Gould, using her finger to unlock her phone and text her friends to try to make it look as if she had killed herself.</p><h2 class=article__heading>Telltale signs</h2><p>Griffiths initially tried to claim he hadn't been near the family's Wilshire house, a county in south-west England, but marks on his face were telltale signs for investigators.</p><p>Gould, who had hopes of joining the police force, was studying for her trial exams when Griffiths knocked on her door.

I haven't seen her today,'" Taylor said.</p><p>"So he is immediately already trying to lay the foundations down of his lies and deceit."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/mrXtjFAuXpgvl1qG4JJTu0x4G4k=/16x10/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/RUUJD6PRESQIVOTWRRVJ2A63EU.jpg"><p>Griffiths stabbed Ellie multiple times in the neck before disposing of a number of items in the woods and going back to school.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>He also sent a chilling text with a selfie to a group of friends explaining he "scratched" himself out of stress.</p><p>"I think everyone noticed that I've been rly [sic] down lately and I need to tell you why," Griffiths' text read.
