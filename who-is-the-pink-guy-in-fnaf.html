The most important one is William Afton, a genius animatronics engineer who designed and built the series' animatronics we know and (kind of) love. He's also the one behind the child-killings mentioned in FNAF 1, FNAF 2, and FNAF 3.<h2>Who is Ennard?</h2>Ennard, also known as Molten Freddy in FNaF 6, is the true main antagonist of Sister Location and a major antagonist in Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria Simulator.<h2>Is FNAF based on a true story?</h2>The Five Nights at Freddy's series consists of horror-themed video games in which the player is usually a night-time employee at a location connected with Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, a fictional children's restaurant that takes inspiration from family pizza chains like Chuck E. Cheese's and ShowBiz Pizza Place.<h2>Why did Michael Afton turn purple?</h2>After being reanimated and becoming a living corpse, he appears to be physically dark purple, due to his skin rotting.<h2>Who did the bite of 87?</h2>The Bite of '87 was an incident that occurred in 1987 at the New Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, during the last shift of Jeremy Fitzgerald, when he was bitten by Toy Bonnie in the forehead, drastically damaging the frontal lobe.<h2>Is Michael Afton the purple guy?</h2>Michael Afton (also known as Purple Guy, Mike, Eggs Benedict in Five Nights at Freddy's: Sister Location) is the son of William Afton and the brother of The Daughter. He is the technician of Circus Baby's Entertainment and Rentals.<h2>Who is Cassidy in FNAF?</h2>Cassidy. Cassidy is a little girl with long black hair and possesses Bonnie. However, in the game series as confirmed by the Animatronics, she is a little boy with blackish blonde hair, possesses Golden Freddy, and possess a little girl-like voice.<h2>What is the lore of FNAF?</h2>The main series' lore found in the original 2014 game comes from newspaper clippings and some stories told in recordings. The player learns of a man hiding in an animatronic suit to lure five children to their murders.<h2>Who was purple guy's first victim?</h2>This is a scene from Five Nights at Freddy's 2 and 6. The first victim of William Afton aka Purple guy was his ex-partner Herny's daughter Charlotte aka Charlie.<h2>Who possesses Golden Freddy?</h2>Golden Freddy is a major character in The Silver Eyes. Unlike the games, He is possessed by a boy named Michael Brooks. In The Silver Eyes, he is also implied to be the mascot suit used to lure the children to the back room.<h2>Is Michael Afton Foxy?</h2>Michael Afton (also known as Eggs Benedict, Mike Schmidt, Foxy Bully, Foxybro and The Brother) is the son of William Afton. He is also the brother of the Crying Child from the fourth game and Elizabeth Afton's brother. He is the manager and owner of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza Place.<h2>How did Vanny become Vanny?</h2>The name Vanny seems to be a portmanteau of Vanessa and Bunny, a fact called out by Glamrock Freddy if the player discovered Vanny's hideout in FazerBlast. While some people believe that to be evidence for Vanessa being Vanny, others see it as too shallow of a connection as the name is too incriminating for Vanessa.<h2>Is the Night Guard Vanny?</h2>Firstly, there is some confusion regarding whether Vanny and Vanessa are different people or one. Well, the answer to that is yes, they are indeed different people in the game. Vanessa plays the role of a security guard in Five Night at Freddy's Security Breach.<h2>Who is Vanny unmasked?</h2>After Freddy sacrifices himself to send Vanny plummeting her demise, Gregory unmasks her to discover that, surprise, surprise, Vannesa is the one beneath the mask.<h2>Who is Terrence Afton?</h2>Terrence Afton (or simply Terrence) is the older brother of Chris, the younger brother of Vincent the 3rd and Michael and the deuteragonist of the 1997 animated Disney film, Five Nights at Freddy's 4. He is voiced by Erik Von Detten.<h2>Why is purple guy called Vincent?</h2>Theguesser wrote: I guess the name was chosen because Vincent sounds like a name for a guy who acts all polite and pleasant on the outside, but truly is just selfish and cruel. But Purple Man has never really shown any emotion :/ That's not exactly fair towards him.<h2>Is the Phone Guy the purple guy?</h2>It has been speculated that Phone Guy is the identity of the Purple Guy that appears in the Death Minigames. The S-A-V-E T-H-E-M minigame, in particular, has the figure pursuing the player while wearing a yellow badge and carrying an object that looks similar to a phone.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9ahpmaho2LBqbGMqaCno12cwrp5yKdkn6aRmw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./beverly-a-greenawalt-obituary-rimersburg-mourns-the-loss-of-a-beloved-resident.html>&#171;&nbsp;Beverly A.
