without capture.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Well-mannered, soft-spoken and pleasant in appearance, Dahmer barely escaped arrest on multiple occasions during his murderous spree, in which he lured men often on society’s fringes back to his home where he would kill and perform acts of necrophilia and cannibalism with their remains, often preserving body parts as mementos.

The first killing was not planned,” Dahmer told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWjYsxaBjBI" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Inside Edition" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Inside Edition</a> in 1993. “I was coming back from the shopping mall back in ’78. I’d had fantasies about picking up a hitchhiker, and taking him back to the house, and having complete dominance and control over him.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The hitchhiker was 18-year-old Steven Hicks, Dahmer’s first victim. Dahmer took Hicks to his parent’s house in Ohio where he strangled and beat him with a barbell before dismembering the body and placing it in trash bags. “No one. No one had a clue as to what was happening for over a decade,” Dahmer said of what would transpire following his first killing.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Dahmer would not murder again until 1987. In the intervening years he had joined the army and was stationed for a time in Germany, eventually being discharged due to problems with excessive drinking. Of those nine years without a victim, Dahmer said the urge was always there; what he lacked were the right circumstances. “There just wasn’t an opportunity to fully express what I wanted to do. There was just not the physical opportunity to do it then.”</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">September 1981: Dahmer returns to Ohio following a military discharge</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Dahmer briefly returned to Ohio to live with his parents following his military discharge, but was arrested for drunk and disorderly conduct, for which he was fined and received a suspended jail sentence. Hoping his grandmother would be a tempering influence on their son's ongoing drinking, Dahmer's parents sent him to live with her in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">August 1982: Dahmer is arrested</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Arrested for indecently exposing himself at Wisconsin State Fair Park, Dahmer was convicted and fined $50.</p><img alt="Jeffrey Dahmer mugshot" title="Jeffrey Dahmer mugshot" width=4978 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/jeffrey-dahmer-mughsot-in-august-1982--photo-by-bureau-of-prisonsgetty-images.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Photo: Bureau of Prisons/Getty Images</span></p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">August 1986: He is charged with disorderly conduct</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Arrested for masturbating in front of two boys, Dahmer told authorities he was merely urinating. Charged with disorderly conduct, he was sentenced to one year of probation and to undergo counseling.</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">September 1987: Dahmer kills his next victim, nine years after his first</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After taking <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://vault.fbi.gov/jeffrey-lionel-dahmer/jeffrey-lionel-dahmer-part-03-of-19/view data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Steven Tuomi" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Steven Tuomi</a>, 24, back to a hotel room, Dahmer says he <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWjYsxaBjBI" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=awoke class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">awoke</a> the following morning to find Tuomi dead alongside him in bed. Dahmer would later tell authorities he had only planned on drugging Tuomi and had no recollection of beating him to death with his fists. Placing the body in a suitcase, Dahmer transported it to his grandmother’s basement where, a week later, he dismembered it and placed it in the trash, except for the head which he retained for a further week before boiling it in industrial detergent and bleach, eventually pulverizing the brittle skull.</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">October 1987: Dahmer lures in another victim</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Dahmer brought 14-year-old James Doxtator to the basement of his grandmother’s house after promising him $50 in exchange for posing for nude photos. After drugging him, Dahmer strangled Doxtator, disposing of his body in similar fashion to that of Tuomi.</p><h2 data-node-id=25 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">March 1988: Dahmer meets his next victim outside a gay bar</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Richard Guerrero met his killer outside a Milwaukee gay bar. Dahmer offered Guerrero $50 to return to his grandmother’s house and spend the night with him. After drugging Guerrero with sleeping pills, Dahmer strangled him before performing sexual acts on the corpse. This time, Dahmer dismembered the body within 24 hours—but hiding his killings and the dismemberments was becoming increasingly difficult.</p><h2 data-node-id=27 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">September 1988: Dahmer is arrested for sexual assault</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Dahmer’s grandmother had become annoyed with his bringing men to her house late at night—and with the foul smells emanating from the basement—so she eventually told him to move out. Within days of securing a one-bedroom apartment, Dahmer was arrested and charged with second-degree sexual assault and enticing a child for immoral purposes after luring 13-year-old Keison Sinthasomphone back to his apartment, where he drugged and molested the boy before his intended victim escaped, taking his story to the police. Dahmer spent a week in jail before being released on bail.</p><h2 data-node-id=29 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">March 1989: After killing his fifth victim, Dahmer begins to keep trophies</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Aspiring model Anthony Sears, 24, became Dahmer’s fifth victim after they met at a bar. Dahmer, fearing his apartment was being watched by the police, brought Sears to his grandmother’s basement to be drugged and strangled. Sears was the first victim from whom Dahmer took trophies, storing and preserving Sears’ head and genitals, which he kept in a wooden box. For a time, he stored the box in his work locker.</p><h2 data-node-id=31 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">May 1989: Dahmer is sentenced to 12 months in jail with work release</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Sentenced to 12 months of jail time and five years of probation for second-degree sexual assault, Dahmer was permitted work release in order to keep his job as a mixer at Ambrosia Chocolate Factory, while also being required to register as a sex offender. Paroled from jail two months early, Dahmer rented an apartment at 924 North 25th Street in Milwaukee.</p><h2 data-node-id=33 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">May 1990: Shortly after his release, Dahmer kills again</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Just months after being released from jail, Dahmer killed Raymond Smith, a 32-year-old prostitute he had offered $50 for sex. After drugging Smith at his North 25th St. apartment, Dahmer strangled him with his hands before taking Polaroid pictures of the corpse in suggestive poses. Dismembering the body in his bathroom, Dahmer boiled the remains, dissolving them in a container of acid except for Smith’s skull, which he kept in a cabinet alongside Sears’ skull. When neighbors complained of the smell emanating from his apartment, Dahmer told them his refrigerator was broken and he was waiting to get it fixed.</p><h2 data-node-id=35 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">June 1990: Dahmer kills again and attempts to preserve the body</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After killing 27-year-old Edward Smith, Dahmer attempted to retain the body by keeping it in a freezer for several months. The frozen corpse was eventually discarded, with Dahmer telling authorities he was upset he did not get to keep any of Smith’s body parts due to degradation in the freezer.</p><img alt="Jeffrey Dahmer" title="Jeffrey Dahmer" width=1820 height=2440 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/dahmer-in-jail-photo-credit-should-read-eugene-garciaafpgetty-images.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Photo: EUGENE GARCIA/AFP/Getty Images</span></p><h2 data-node-id=40 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">September 1990: Dahmer claims two more victims, but deviates from his previous methods</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Ernest Miller, 22, had his throat slashed after being promised money to join Dahmer at his apartment. A lack of sleeping pills forced Dahmer to change his method of killing. Dahmer kept parts of Miller’s body to eat, something he was doing increasingly, and he painted and displayed Miller's head in his apartment.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=42 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Three weeks later, Dahmer killed 22-year-old David Thomas. Later, he said he came to realize during their encounter that he was not attracted to Thomas, but he still drugged and killed him, then disposed of his body, intentionally not keeping any parts.</p><h2 data-node-id=43 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">February 1991: A tenth victim is murdered</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=44 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Dahmer picked up 17-year-old Curtis Straughter at a bus stop, offering him money in exchange for nude photos. Dahmer continued his rituals with his tenth victim: offers of cash to a stranger, drugging and strangling his victim before taking photos, dismembering and keeping body parts for cannibalism and trophies. Following his arrest, Dahmer <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWjYsxaBjBI" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=said class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">said</a> eating his victims was a compulsion, a way of “making me feel they were a part of me.”</p><h2 data-node-id=45 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">April 1991: Dahmer attempts to put a victim into a "zombie-like" state</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=46 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After drugging 19-year-old Errol Lindsey, Dahmer drilled a hole in his skull, into which he poured hydrochloric acid in an attempt to produce what Dahmer would describe as a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWjYsxaBjBI" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="“zombie-like” state" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">“zombie-like” state</a> in his victim. Lindsey regained consciousness before Dahmer drugged him further, and then strangled him and flayed the corpse with the intention of retaining Lindsey’s skin.</p><h2 data-node-id=47 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">May 1991: He narrowly escapes capture</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=48 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Dahmer’s next victim, 31-year-old Anthony Hughes, was dead, but still intact on the floor when he lured 14-year-old Konerak Sinthasomphone to his North 25th St. apartment. After photographing and drugging Sinthasomphone, Dahmer again tried to render his victim brain dead by <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://vault.fbi.gov/jeffrey-lionel-dahmer/jeffrey-lionel-dahmer-part-03-of-19/view data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="drilling into his skull" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">drilling into his skull</a> and <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://apnews.com/article/081e72cc128d2bfa7b9b3cf070e232f7 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="inserting acid" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">inserting acid</a>, leaving the drugged body alongside Hughes’ corpse while he left the apartment for a few hours.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=49 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Returning in the early hours of the following morning, Dahmer discovered a groggy Sinthasomphone sitting outside the apartment building with three women huddled around him. Telling the women Sinthasomphone was his friend, Dahmer attempted to lead the boy back to the apartment to the dismay of the women, who informed Dahmer they had already called the police.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=50 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Dahmer eventually convinced attending police that Sinthasomphone was his 19-year-old boyfriend and that they had quarreled after drinking too much. Amid protests from the women, the officers escorted Dahmer and Sinthasomphone back to the apartment, where Dahmer produced the Polaroids he had taken earlier as proof of their relationship. Categorizing the event as a domestic dispute, the three officers left Sinthasomphone with Dahmer in the apartment, which they noted had a strange odor.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=51 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Dahmer once again drilled Sinthasomphone’s head and injected it with acid, this time with fatal results. By coincidence, Sinthasomphone was the younger brother of the boy Dahmer had molested in 1988—a crime for which he was convicted—though according to Dahmer, he had no idea of their connection. After dismembering their bodies, Dahmer kept the skulls of both Hughes and Sinthasomphone.</p><h2 data-node-id=52 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">June 1991: Dahmer lures in another victim with the promise of a photo shoot</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=53 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Dahmer met 20-year-old Matthew Turner in Chicago and persuaded him to travel to Milwaukee for a photo shoot. Once again, Dahmer drugged, strangled and dismembered his victim, keeping the head and internal organs in plastic bags in his freezer.</p><h2 data-node-id=54 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">July 7-19 1991: Three more victims are killed</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=55 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Choosing another victim from Chicago, Dahmer promised Jeremiah Weinberger, 20, a weekend away at his apartment in Milwaukee. Dahmer did not commit the murder until the day following their arrival, when Weinberger voiced his intention to leave.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=56 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Days later, after agreeing to pose nude, 24-year-old Oliver Lacy accompanied Dahmer back to his apartment, where Lacy was drugged and then administered chloroform over the course of a day in an attempt to render him alive, but unconscious. After strangling Lacy, Dahmer had sex with the corpse, storing the head and heart in the refrigerator and the skeleton in a freezer.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=57 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Four days after murdering Lacy, Dahmer was fired from his job. The same day, Dahmer lured Joseph Bradehoft, 25, to his apartment, strangling him and laying the body on the bed where it remained for two days. He then placed Bradehoft’s head in the refrigerator.</p><h2 data-node-id=58 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">July 22, 1991: Dahmer's killing spree comes to an end</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=59 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Two Milwaukee police officers were <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/cannibal-and-serial-killer-jeffrey-dahmer-is-caught data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="flagged down" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">flagged down</a> by an agitated man with handcuffs attached at one wrist. Tracey Edwards, 32, told the officers a “freak” had placed the handcuffs on him and that he had spent the better part of the evening trying to escape from a nearby apartment where he was being held captive.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=60 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Dahmer had met Edwards earlier that day, and persuaded him to accompany him to his apartment. Upon entering, Edwards immediately noticed a foul smell and stacked boxes of hydrochloric acid. Dahmer had tried to place handcuffs on Edwards, succeeding only in fastening one wrist before he brandished a knife, pulling Edwards toward the bedroom where Dahmer said he intended to take nude pictures.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=61 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Continually repeating he was Dahmer’s “friend,” Edwards waited until his captor had a lapse of concentration whereupon he punched Dahmer in the face. In the confusion Edwards fled through the front door, eventually flagging down the police car.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=62 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Upon their arrival at his apartment, Dahmer invited the attending officers inside, admitting it was he who had placed the handcuffs on Edwards and that the keys were in his nightstand. On entering the bedroom, one officer noticed a partially open drawer filled with Polaroid pictures of numerous bodies in differing states of dismemberment.
