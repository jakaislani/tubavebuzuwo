It is a program where business owners showcase their business ideas before a panel of investors (known as ‘sharks’) who also serve as judges of the presentation. The aim is for the business owners to convince the judges to fund their ideas. Of course, this already implies that the judges are wealthy folks. Although they fund a lot of these ideas, these judges are also known for the stilted ways in which they often reject well-choreographed and competitively scrutinized proposals. Since this is a show that is centered around business and money, let’s talk about the net worth of the Shark Tank cast members.</p><p>Below is a list of the cast members, their net worths and how they achieved such financial values.
