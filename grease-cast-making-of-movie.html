A previous film of hers had flopped and she "was 29 and worried that I didn't look young enough" to portray high school student Sandy. It was only after a successful screen test and interacting with Travolta that she agreed to take the role, telling <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://ew.com/article/2010/07/22/hopelessly-devoted-grease/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Entertainment Weekly" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Entertainment Weekly</a>, "John and I had great chemistry from the first time we met."

Stockard Channing was then up for the role, but there were worries that the 33-year-old actress wouldn't be able to pull off high schooler Rizzo. According to Vanity Fair, the movie's director, Randal Kleiser, decided he'd check all cast members, including Channing, to see if he could spot wrinkles around their eyes. Each of the movie's potential actors had to pass his so-called "crow's-feet test" to officially get the role.</p><img alt="Grease cast" title="Grease cast" width=5158 height=3430 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/ed39b45f-f08e-4da7-a1d5-8aeb42162ce4.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">(L-R) Jeff Conaway, Olivia Newton-John, John Travolta and Stockard Channing in "Grease"; Photo: Paramount Pictures/Fotos International/Getty Images</span></p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Filming in hot California posed problems for the cast</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Though the stage play was set in Chicago, the movie version of Grease was filmed in California during the summer of 1977. That provided a sunnier backdrop, but it also meant high temperatures. During the filming of the high school dance, the gym became sweltering for the cast. But they couldn't keep windows open for too long because a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/get-schooled-history-where-grease-really-filmed-180969001/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="pork-processing plant" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">pork-processing plant</a> was emitting noxious odors that would permeate the setting. Director Kleiser later told Los Angeles Magazine, "People would lie down on the gymnasium floor just to deal with the exhaustion."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">A similar problem occurred when the finale, "We Go Together," was filmed on a high school football field. Kelly Ward, who played T-Bird member Putzie, told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/grease-turns-40-pink-ladies-t-birds-remember-wild-ride-filming-carnival-finale-154004386.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Yahoo Entertainment" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Yahoo Entertainment</a> in 2018, "There were people who were passing out from dehydration and heat exhaustion and so forth during that sequence. It was an oppressively hot set because there was no place to hide. There was no shade, really. It was high summer and we were outdoors and it was hot."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">One day, the actors playing the T-Birds — Barry Pearl (Doody), Michael Tucci (Sonny), Jeff Conaway (Kenickie) and Ward— decided to take advantage of the Southern California location and go sailing during a daytime break in their filming schedule. They needed to be back that evening to shoot a scene and thought they had plenty of time — until the wind stopped and their sailboat was stranded. The group only made it to the night shoot on time when the boat's captain performed a wind-summoning dance that actually worked. Ward told Yahoo Entertainment that the experience was "a major bonding moment for the T-Birds!"</p><img alt="Olivia Newton-John Grease" title="Olivia Newton-John Grease" width=4292 height=3421 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/1a5b35a9-5a10-4b58-a5c8-0d6a577e45d3.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Olivia Newton-John and female cast members singing "Summer Nights"; Photo: Paramount/Getty Images</span></p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">The musical numbers were constantly changing</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Though Channing got to play Rizzo, she almost didn't get the chance to deliver the powerful song "There Are Worse Things I Could Do," in which Rizzo takes ownership of her sexuality and personal choices. Channing told Vanity Fair that producer Carr considered the song "a downer." She only convinced him it was necessary to include it by arguing, "That’s how you know what’s inside this little person. Otherwise, she’s just all that surface stuff."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Also, the romantic lament "Hopelessly Devoted to You," sung by Newton-John, wasn't included until after filming had finished. And the duet between Newton-John and Travolta at the ending carnival scene, "You’re the One That I Want," was another last-minute addition to the movie. According to Yahoo Entertainment, the choreography was done on the spot. The cast members playing the T-Birds and Pink Ladies ended up lip-synching their lines. Pearl, who played Doody of the T-Birds, later explained to Yahoo Entertainment, "It was a song we had never heard before."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Many of the stage show's songs were cut from the movie. "Greased Lightnin'" was a stage number that did make it into the film, but not without a few changes. Onstage, the character of Kenickie is the one singing about his car, but in the movie, Travolta's Zuko handles the tune. "I have to be completely honest with you," Travolta told Vanity Fair. "I wanted the number. And because I had clout, I could get the number." However, it could've been worse — another plan the production had considered was bringing in the Beach Boys to sing the song.</p><img alt="Grease John Travolta" title="Grease John Travolta" width=5199 height=3371 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/def01a98-2dd9-45c9-8211-f44cab195a89.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">John Travolta and the T-Birds singing "Greased Lightnin'"&lt;br tml-linebreak="true">; Photo: Paramount Pictures/Fotos International/Getty Images</span></p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">The 15-week shoot was a 'labor of love'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">There was plenty of emotional upheaval going on during the making of Grease. Conaway resented Travolta for taking the song "Greased Lightnin'" away from him. Travolta was still coping with the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/archive/cover-story-life-after-loss-vol-7-no-23/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="death of his girlfriend" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">death of his girlfriend</a>, actress Diana Hyland, in March 1977, and often called Grease's director seeking support. Conaway ended up falling for <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/archive/from-grease-jeff-conaway-careened-into-tvs-taxi-and-love-with-newton-johns-sister-vol-10-no-16/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Newton-John's older sister" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Newton-John's older sister</a> when they met at a party. For Newton-John, pulling off her character's last-minute transformation from good girl to T-Bird temptress "was an opening up for me. I felt from it that I wanted to try different things. I was open to everything new," she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/olivia-newton-john-battles-back-240738/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rolling Stone" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Rolling Stone</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Amidst these moments of emotion, the actors bonded. Pearl told Yahoo Entertainment, "We all got along. It was 15 weeks of a labor of love. You see it when you watch it." Per Didi Conn, who had the role of Pink Lady Frenchy, "What was so much fun was that most of us were older than the characters we were playing so we just stayed in character all day long," she explained to the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-5710201/Grease-EXCLUSIVE-Didi-Conn-lifts-lid-John-Travoltas-true-feelings-Olivia-Newton-John.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Daily Mail" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Daily Mail</a>. At the end of filming, the cast had enjoyed themselves so much they were ready to make a proposed sequel, Summer School.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">However, producers didn't know how big a hit they had on their hands and the proposed sequel wasn't filmed (a few years later Grease 2, starring <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/michelle-pfeiffer data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Michelle Pfeiffer" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Michelle Pfeiffer</a>, would get the green light, but it didn't recapture the success or the magic of the original movie). Before heading their separate ways, cast members were able to enjoy themselves one last time at the wrap party. According to Conn, Channing brought some "special brownies" to the event, which she shared with everyone. Conn said in a Daily Mail interview that her recollection of the party is therefore vague: "I really don't remember much, just dancing and lying on the floor laughing with everybody."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGikqK6ZmsBuwNVonqudkaiybq%2FArKtmpZGgtq%2BzjKidZqWfq7am</p></div><div id=links><a href=./great-movie-persona-1966.html>&#171;&nbsp;Persona movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1967)</a>
